# VectorNode
My repo of vector based generative art with paper.js with a node server for local development, 

All of these (and more) are served on my website over at [Webs.Wonday.eu](https://webs.wonday.eu/). Some of them are just work in progress or quick tests of specific functions or methods.

# use 

npm install the modules

then run the server with 
`node socket_server.js`

this will run localhost:8000
the pages are served statically so just open them with 

`localhost:8000/html/FILENAME.html`
